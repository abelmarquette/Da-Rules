Rules for CYS OPS Discord server
Welcome! Are you even CYS OPS? This server is for anyone and everyone Cyber System Operations. Below is the rule list for this server. Follow the rules or I'll pull a 341 or something. Not really, you'll probably just get kicked after a few warnings.
- The BS'ing channel is for just fucking around and talking in general
- In the Studying channel we talk about class and studying stuff specifically, nothing else
- Song requests is for when we are in a voice channel and wanna use Rythym to play music
- Don't talk in General unless you're an admin and have a server wide point to make
- The Admin-Chat channel is for admins to discuss what admins want to do to make the server better
- And Cute-Animals is for, well, cute animals
